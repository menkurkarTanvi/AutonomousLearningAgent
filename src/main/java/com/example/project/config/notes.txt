@Congiguration is  Spring annotation used to indicate that the class contains Spring
bean definitions. This of it like a replacement for XML config files

When yo annotate with @Configuration, you are telling Spring:
this class is for configuration fo your application. I'll define some beans here
that you should manage

Why is it needed
Spring needs to know how to create na manage certain objects (beans) in your app
like services, repositories, clients, etc
-Let Spring automatically detect and manage classes using annotations
like @Component, @Service, @Repository
- Or Define your beans manually using @Configuration

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService(); // Spring will manage this as a bean
    }
}

How it used with @Bean
- THe @Bean annotation tells Spring
Create and isntance of this methods return value and manageu it as a bean in 
the Spring container

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
        return new RestTemplate();
    }
}
Now anywhere in your app, you can inject RestTemplate like this:

@Autowired
private RestTemplate restTemplate;
